# Unnamed Language Project

A work-in-progress compiler for an as-yet unnamed language, this project was
begun as an opportunity to develop skills working at lower abstraction levels.

As such, this is intended to focus on being a high-performance and low overhead
language, giving experienced developers a different (hopefully better) tool for
building tightly optimized software.

The initial compiler is being written in C for both performance and to gain
additional domain experience.
